The Service is operated by Blockdum (the “Company”, “we” or “us”) for users of the Service (“you”). This Privacy Policy sets forth our policy with respect to information that is collected from visitors to the Site and users of the App and/or the Services. Under applicable law, Blockdum is the “data controller” of personal data collected through the Services.

      OUR LEGAL BASES FOR HANDLING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA
    </h1>
        <h1>
      ⠀
    </h1>
    <samp>
      The laws in some jurisdictions require companies to tell you about the legal ground they rely on to use or disclose your personal data. To the extent those laws apply, our legal grounds are as follows:
      To honor our contractual commitments to you: Much of our processing of personal data is to meet our contractual obligations to our users, or to take steps at users’ request in anticipation of entering into a contract with them. For example, we handle personal data on this basis to login with your discord account and provide our Services.
      Legitimate interests: In many cases, we handle personal data on the ground that it furthers our legitimate interests in ways that are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the affected individuals: 
      This includes:
      (i) Providing a safe and enjoyable user experience;
      (ii) Customer service;
      (iii) Protecting our users, personnel, and property;
      (iv) Analyzing and improving our business, e.g. collecting information about how you use our Services to optimize the design and placement of certain features;
      (v) Managing legal issues.
      (vi) Legal compliance: We need to use and disclose personal data in certain ways to comply with our legal obligations.
      (vii) To protect the vital interests of the individual or others: For example, we may collect or share personal data to help resolve an urgent situation.
      (viii) Consent: Where required by law, and in some other cases, we handle personal data on the basis of your implied or express consent.

      ⠀
    </h1>
    <samp>
      The Company is not in the business of selling your information. We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your information with certain third parties, as set forth below:
 
 
     (i) Consent: We may transfer your information with your consent.
     (ii) Legal Requirements: We may disclose your information if required to do so by      law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of the Company or Related Companies, (iii) protect the personal safety of users of the Services or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.
     (iii) Aggregated or Non-identifiable Data: We may also share aggregated or non-personally identifiable information with our partners or others for business purposes.

      DATA RETENTION

    <samp>
      All data about you is not stored anywhere, it gets deleted the second you successfully logged in and the server has sent us the login code. We will not collect data if you are not logged in. So there is no possibility for the data to be leaked. So we can't really send you your data.

      We take reasonable steps to protect the information provided via the Services from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, email sent to or from the Services may not be secure. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via email. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any information via the Internet.

      We believe that users should be treated equally no matter where they are, and so we are making the following options to control your data available to all users, regardless of their location.
 
      Q: How can I access the personal data you have about me?
      A: As we mentioned earlier, we do not store data anywhere on our systems. So we will not be able to send you your data. What we will send is the data that is created when you sign up for the Beta or/and the developer programs.
